- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Sophie
- ðŸ‘€ With 5 years of experience in Workplace Management Consulting, I decided to focus on a SaaS product for real estate professionals. In order to be able to code an MVP, I followed a 6-month training to become a full-stack developer. I am working on this project on my free time, and found a first job as a developer in a french start up.
